### **Aim:**

To develop a prompt-based application tailored to personal needs, fostering creativity and practical problem-solving skills while leveraging the capabilities of large language models.

---

### **Algorithm:**

Develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT
to demonstrate how to create a prompt-based application to organize daily tasks,
showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.

---

### **AI Tools Required:**

* **For Assistance:** ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek
* **For Video Generation:** Runway
* **For Image Generation:** Midjourney

---

### **Prompt:**

"Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks, schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries. The assistant should interact using natural language and be adaptable to the user’s changing preferences over time."

---

### **Procedure:**

1. **Define Core Requirements** – Establish the essential functionalities of a productivity assistant.
2. **Prompt Design** – Construct clear and structured prompts for each feature using an LLM like ChatGPT.
3. **Interaction Simulation** – Build a basic interface or use command-line interaction for user simulation.
4. **User Feedback Loop** – Gather inputs and simulate response adaptation for personalization.
5. **(Optional)** Implement basic memory to track and adjust to user preferences over time.

# **Output**
## **Compact Personal Productivity Assistant (PPA)**  

## **1. Core Features**  
- **Task Management**: Add, prioritize, and track tasks with smart deadline suggestions.  
- **Smart Reminders**: Time, location, or behavior-based alerts (e.g., "You usually gym now").  
- **Wellness Tips**: Hydration breaks, stretch reminders, and mood logging.  
- **Quick Answers**: Weather, news, and general knowledge via natural language.  

## **2. Interaction & Adaptability**  
- **Voice/Text Commands**: "Move my 3 PM meeting to 4."  
- **Learns Preferences**: Adjusts reminders based on past behavior.  
- **Feedback-Driven**: "Snooze for 30 mins" → learns procrastination patterns.  

## **3. Tech & Privacy**  
- **Mobile/Web App**: Syncs with Google Calendar, Apple Health, etc.  
- **Secure**: Encrypted data, optional local processing.

### **Example Flow**  
1. **Morning Check-In**: "Good morning! You have a meeting at 10 AM. Want to review your notes first?"  
2. **Midday Focus**: "You’ve been working on the report for 2 hours—take a 5-minute break?"  
3. **Evening Wind-Down**: "Great job today! You finished 4/5 tasks. Ready to schedule tomorrow’s priorities?"  

**Why It Works**:Proactive, personalized, and keeps productivity balanced with well-being.

### **Result:**

The prompt was executed successfully. The experiment led to the development of a conceptual prototype of a personal assistant powered by large language models.
